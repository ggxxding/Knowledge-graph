IFNL3 genotype is only one factor that could influence response rates to PEG-IFN alpha\u0001 and RBV therapy in HCV genotype 1 infection and should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and genetic factors. &quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;For patients treated with PEG-IFN alpha\u0001 and RBV alone, IFNL3 genotype is the strongest pretreatment predictor of HCV treatment response. In the intention to treat analysis of the original discovery cohort with <a href=\"/variant/PA166155468\">rs12979860</a>, Caucasian CC genotype patients were more likely than CT or TT patients to be undetectable by week 4 (28% versus 5% and 5%, P&lt;0.0001) and to achieve SVR (69% versus 33% and 27%, P&lt;0.0001). Similar patterns were observed in Hispanic and African American patients in this cohort. HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects, and the likelihood of response treatment influences shared decision making between clinicians and patients about initiating treatment.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;For treatment naïve patients with genotype 1 infection who are treated with protease inhibitor combinations, all IFNL3 genotypes have improved response rates compared to PEG-IFN alpha\u0001 and RBV only. However, patients with the favorable IFNL3 genotype still have higher response rates with the protease inhibitor combination in treatment naïve patients, and these response rates may guide patients and clinicians in their treatment decisions. In the boceprevir phase 3 naïve study of combination with PEG-IFN alpha\u0001 and RBV, SVR rates for <a href=\"/variant/PA166155468\">rs12979860</a> CC patients receiving boceprevir ranged from 80-82% compared to 65-71% for CT patients and 59-65% for TT patients. Moreover, multivariate regression analysis revealed that <a href=\"/variant/PA166155468\">rs12979860</a> CC was a predictor of SVR compared to CT (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.1) and TT genotypes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.7).&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/pegintron/2013/24096968.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for IFNL3 (IL28B) genotype and PEG interferon-alpha-based regimens</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/pegintron/2013/24096968-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2013 supplement</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-therapeutic-use-of-peg-interferon-alpha-containing-regimens-based-on-ifnl3-genotype\">Table 1: Recommended therapeutic use of  PEG-interferon-alpha containing regimens based on <em>IFNL3</em> genotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Table 1 and 2 of the 2013 guideline manuscript</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Genotype at <a href=\"/variant/PA166155468\">rs12979860</a></th><th>Phenotype</th><th>Implications for PEG-IFN alpha\u0001 and RBV <sup>a</sup></th><th>Implications for protease inhibitor combinations with PEG-IFN alpha\u0001 and RBV therapy</th><th>Classification of recommendations <sup>b</sup></th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>CC</td><td>Favorable response genotype</td><td>Approximately 70% chance for SVR <sup>c</sup> after 48 weeks of treatment.
