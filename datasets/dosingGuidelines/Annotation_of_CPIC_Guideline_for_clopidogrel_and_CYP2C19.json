    "summary" : "Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 catalyzes the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel, and CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles impair formation of active metabolites, resulting in reduced platelet inhibition. In addition, CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles confer increased risks for serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) events among clopidogrel-treated patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Guideline updates include emphasis on appropriate indication for CYP2C19 genotype-directed antiplatelet therapy, refined recommendations for specific CYP2C19 alleles, and additional evidence from an expanded literature review (updates at http://www.pharmgkb.org).",

The currently available evidence indicates that the *17 gain-of-function allele is unable to completely compensate for the *2 loss-of-function allele [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/20492469\">20492469</a>]; however, this data has not been consistently replicated and is therefore a provisional classification (Table S5).</p>\n<p>An important caveat for all genotyping tests is that the &quot;wild-type&quot; (*1) status is reported if all other alleles that are measured are absent.  Some genotype tests do not interrogate the rare loss of function alleles and therefore, if present, they may be erroneously reported as &quot;wild type&quot;. Furthermore, in human DNA, it is always possible that a new, previously undiscovered (and therefore un-interrogated) site of variation may confer altered enzyme function in an individual, and thus lead to the rare possibility of a loss-of-function allele being erroneously called as &quot;wild-type&quot; (*1). The guidelines do not focus on demographic and other clinical variables, such as adherence to therapy, age, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, and concomitant use of other drugs that may influence clopidogrel efficacy and clinical decision making.</p>\n<p><strong>The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has endorsed the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for cytochrome P450-2C19 (CYP2C19) genotype and clopidogrel therapy.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"august-2011\">August 2011</h3>\n<p><em>Advance online publication June 2011.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing for clopidogrel were published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">(CPIC)</a>.</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/clopidogrel/2011/21716271.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for cytochrome P450-2C19 (CYP2C19) genotype and clopidogrel therapy</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/clopidogrel/2011/21716271-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2011 supplement</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
