They recommend choosing an alternative for patients with the SLCO1B1 521 CC or TC (rs4149056) genotype and with ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS for statin-induced myopathy. For patients without additional significant risk factors for statin-induced myopathy, they advise contacting their doctor in the event of muscle symptoms.</p>\n<p><em>Wording in table taken from <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.knmp.nl/downloads/pharmacogenetic-recommendations-november-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.knmp.nl/downloads/pharmacogenetic-recommendations-november-2018.pdf</a></em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Allele/Genotype/Phenotype</th><th>Drug</th><th>Description</th><th>Recommendation</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>512 CC</td><td>atorvastatin</td><td>The genetic polymorphism may lead to reduced atorvastatin transport to the liver.

Choose an alternative. Rosuvastatin and pravastatin are influenced to a similar extent by SLCO1B1 polymorphisms but are not influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as amiodarone, verapamil and diltiazem. Fluvastatin is not influenced by SLCO1B1 polymorphisms or CYP3A4 inhibitors.<br/>2.
